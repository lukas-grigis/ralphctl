# Changelog

All notable changes to RalphCTL will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.5] - 2026-04-09

### Changed

- **Prompt templates consolidated into shared partials** — `harness-context`, `signals-task|planning|evaluation`,
  `validation-checklist`, and `plan-common` live as standalone `.md` files and are composed into each template at
  build time. Eliminates literal duplication across all 7 prompt templates; adding new shared content is now a
  one-line change (#61)
- **Strict `composePrompt()` contract** — Builder throws synchronously on any unreplaced `{{TOKEN}}` instead of
  silently rendering empty placeholders. Closes the silent-failure class called out in `CLAUDE.md` about missing
  substitutions (#61)
- **Target-project tooling threaded into planner and ideate prompts** — `sprint plan` and `sprint ideate` now surface
  the downstream project's `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/skills/`, `.mcp.json` servers, and instruction files with
  prescriptive delegation hints in generated task steps. Previously only the evaluator prompt (0.2.4) saw this.
  `implementer` and `planner` remain denylisted at detection time so the evaluator never delegates back to its own
  generator side (#61)
- **Prompt audit tests** — New per-template assertions enforce "prompts run in downstream projects — never hardcode
  ralphctl's own name or subagents" as test-as-documentation. Fails at CI time if a future template drifts (#61)

### Documentation

- **README refresh** — Surface branch-per-sprint workflow (`--branch`, `sprint close --create-pr`), the
  `sprint insights` command, and `evaluationIterations` tuning with the `--no-evaluate` single-run escape hatch —
  all shipped since the 0.2.2 README redesign but were never documented (#61)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md sync** — Drop phantom `Ticket.externalId` and `DuplicateTicketError`; add `Repository.checkTimeout`,
  `Task.verificationCriteria`, `Task.evaluationStatus`, `Task.evaluationFile`, the `evaluations/` sidecar directory,
  and the top-level `insights/` directory. Error-class table now reflects what's actually exported from
  `src/errors.ts` (#61)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Sidecar critique persistence** — Full untruncated evaluator critique persisted to
  `<sprintDir>/evaluations/<taskId>.md`, one entry per iteration. `tasks.json` keeps a 2000-char preview in
  `evaluationOutput`, the file path in `evaluationFile`, and a status discriminator in `evaluationStatus`
  (`'passed' | 'failed' | 'malformed'`). Bail cases (no `<task-complete>`, generator no-op, recheck failure) append
  self-explanatory stub entries so the trail is readable without cross-referencing executor stdout (#60)
- **Project tooling detection** — Evaluator prompt now surfaces installed `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/skills/`,
  `.mcp.json` servers, and instruction files (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) with
  prescriptive delegation hints (`auditor` for security-sensitive diffs, `reviewer` for code quality, Playwright MCP
  for UI tasks). `implementer` and `planner` are denylisted at detection time so the evaluator never delegates back
  to its own generator side (#60)
- **Malformed evaluator status** — New `'malformed'` discriminator distinguishes "evaluator output had no parseable
  signal" from a real failure. The fix loop now bails before feeding garbage to the generator as a "critique" (#60)

### Changed

- **Evaluator participates in parallel rate-limit coordinator** — Waits during global pauses and triggers them on its
  own 429s, so generator tasks back off when the evaluator hits the wall first instead of stampeding into the same
  wall (#60)
- **Evaluator capped at 100 turns** — Lower than executor's 200; review work doesn't need a runaway budget (#60)
- **Evaluator spawn failures no longer crash the sprint** — `runEvaluation` calls are wrapped in a safe helper that
  converts errors to malformed results, matching the "evaluator never permanently blocks" contract documented in
  CLAUDE.md (#60)
- **`evaluationIterations` semantics clarified** — Now documented as "number of fix attempts after the initial
  evaluation". Default `1` = 1 initial eval + up to 1 fix-and-reeval round = at most 2 evaluator spawns. `0` disables
  evaluation entirely (#60)
- **Resume prompt extracted to template file** — Inline 7-line generator-resume prompt moved from `executor.ts` to
  `src/ai/prompts/task-evaluation-resume.md` so it can be reviewed alongside the other prompt templates (#60)

### Fixed

- **Sequential post-task check ignored per-repo `checkTimeout`** — Now correctly threaded into both `runLifecycleHook`
  and the evaluation loop's recheck. Parallel mode was already correct; only the sequential path was affected (#60)
- **No-op generator fix attempts now break the loop** — After a generator resume, the executor compares HEAD SHA and
  working-tree state; if neither changed, it bails instead of burning another evaluator spawn on the same critique
  (#60)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Verification criteria** — new `verificationCriteria` field on Task schema, surfaced in task context and evaluator
  prompt as the grading contract; JSON schemas (`tasks.schema.json`, `task-import.schema.json`) updated with sync tests
  (#57)
- **Evaluator dimension scoring** — structured PASS/FAIL parsing per dimension (correctness, completeness, safety,
  consistency) with per-dimension findings (#57)
- **Sprint insights** — new `sprint insights` command to analyze evaluation results and surface patterns across tasks
  (#57)

### Changed

- **Executor hardening** — `--max-turns` safety net (default 200), session ID tracking across evaluation iterations,
  correct model propagation on fix attempts (#57)
- **Prompt quality** — all 7 prompt templates rewritten per Anthropic's current best practices: toned down urgency
  language, added "why" explanations, XML structural tags, harness context (#57)
- **Documentation** — CLAUDE.md gains environment variables, build/distribution, and release sections; README adds
  reference links to Anthropic harness design articles
- Deduplicated console capture into shared `captureOutput` test helper

### Fixed

- Path traversal protection on ticket ID segments (#57)

### Dependencies

- Bumped `@types/node` from 25.5.0 to 25.5.2

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Redesigned README — new "Why ralphctl?" section, workflow diagram, features reframed as user benefits, collapsed CLI
  reference and provider comparison tables
- Improved 7 AI prompt templates — fixed `__tests__` rendering bug, added evaluator pass-bar guidance, clarified harness
  check behavior, added blocker handling to ideate-auto, softened prescriptive acceptance criteria wording
- Enhanced evaluation resume prompt with structured iteration steps and scope boundaries (aligned with Anthropic harness
  design patterns)

### Fixed

- Incorrect `dashboard` command reference in README (actual CLI command is `status`)
- Stale test comment claiming `.replace()` when code uses `.replaceAll()`; strengthened token replacement assertion

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- Evaluation resume prompt now instructs the generator to commit fixes, ensuring re-evaluation can see changes via
  `git diff`; respects `--no-commit` flag

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Generator-evaluator pattern** — autonomous code review after task completion with model ladder
  (Opus->Sonnet, Sonnet->Haiku, Haiku->Haiku); configurable `evaluationIterations`; `--no-evaluate` flag (#49)
- **Sprint ideation** — `sprint ideate` combines refine + plan in one session for quick ideas; auto-assigns ticketId;
  handles bare tasks array output (#51)
- **Budget and model controls** — `--max-budget-usd` and `--fallback-model` flags for `sprint start`
- **Per-repo check timeout** — configurable check script timeout per repository with failure isolation
- **Interactive config menu** — editor and evaluation iterations configurable from interactive mode

  with headless execution and session ID capture
- **Draft re-plan** — running `sprint plan` on a draft with existing tasks passes all tickets + tasks as AI context for
  atomic replacement
- **Check script model** — single idempotent `checkScript` per repo replaces old `setupScript`/`verifyScript`; runs at
  sprint start and as a post-task gate
- **Lifecycle hooks** — `runLifecycleHook()` abstraction in `src/ai/lifecycle.ts` with `RALPHCTL_LIFECYCLE_EVENT` env
  var
