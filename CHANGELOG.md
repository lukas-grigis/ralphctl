# Changelog

All notable changes to RalphCTL will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-17

> **Structural rewrite.** Internal architecture, on-disk schema, data root, and several CLI commands
> all changed. **No automatic migration from 0.6.x** — see [README §Upgrading](./README.md#upgrading-from-06x-to-070).

### Breaking

- **On-disk schema is incompatible with 0.6.x.** 0.7.0 reuses `~/.ralphctl/` as the data directory
  (override with `RALPHCTL_HOME=<absolute-path>`), but **back up your 0.6.x data before launching**.
  Each sprint now spans three files — `sprint.json` (planning), `execution.json` (branch / PR / setup
  audit), `tasks.json` (the task list) — instead of the single 0.6.x `sprint.json`. The 0.6.x layout
  does not parse; the first read against legacy files surfaces a `ParseError`. Recommended:
  `mv ~/.ralphctl ~/.ralphctl.0.6-backup` before installing 0.7.0.
- **`settings.json` schema changed.** Per-flow model selection replaces the single global `model`
  setting; each chain (`refine`, `plan`, `implement`, `ideate`, `readiness`) picks its own. 0.6.x
  settings files are rejected on read — re-run `ralphctl settings` to reconfigure.
- **CLI surface intentionally smaller.** These commands were removed in favour of the TUI:
  `sprint feedback / edit`, `ticket approve / edit`, `project repo add / remove`, all
  `task add / edit / edit-status / remove`, and `sessions list / attach / detach / kill`. If you
  scripted any of these, switch to the interactive TUI or to the relevant flow command.

### Added

- **OpenAI Codex provider** alongside Claude Code and GitHub Copilot — pick via `ralphctl settings`.
- **Per-flow model selection.** Each chain (`refine`, `plan`, `implement`, `ideate`, `readiness`)
  carries its own model, configurable in `settings.json` or via the settings view.
- **Cross-project sprint lock** prevents two ralphctl sessions on the same machine from racing
  one sprint's on-disk state.
- **Idle-stdout watchdog** kills wedged headless provider children so a stuck Claude / Copilot /
  Codex process can't strand the harness.
- **Resume of aborted Implement runs.** A killed implement loop recovers in-progress tasks on
  the next launch instead of starting clean.
- **Persistent `<sprintDir>/chain.log`** — every chain run streams its trace to disk for post-hoc
  debugging.
- **File-based AI provider contract** — `signals.json` + `sessionId` files replace stdout parsing,
  closing a long-standing source of brittleness when CLI vendors tweak their JSON shape.
- **Exponential backoff on rate-limit retries** (`provider._engine/rate-limit-backoff`).
- **`gen:flow` scaffold generator** — `pnpm gen:flow <name>` produces the manifest + flow stub a
  new chain needs.
- **EventBus + chain-progress streaming.** Adapters publish structured events that the TUI
  subscribes to live (no more polling).

### Changed

- **Internal architecture rewritten** to a function-first composition (no class instances for use
  cases). `Result<T, E>` end-to-end — every `process.exit(1)` is a pattern-matched typed error.
  ESLint enforces the new layer rules (`domain → nothing`, `business → domain`,
  `integration → domain + business`, `application → everything`) plus sibling-isolation rules
  inside `integration/ai/` so flows speak port-level vocabulary only.
- **Prompt corpus tightened by ~36%** with no semantic loss on the rubric, anti-stamp guard, or
  parameter validation — `evaluate` template went from 276 → 150 lines via XML-block → markdown
  conversion. Each template now ships with a branded `Prompt` type and per-template parameter
  schema, so prompt regressions surface at type-check time.
- **TUI rewritten** as a responsive dashboard with a kanban-style Sprint Detail view, a
  pipeline-map Home view, and a multi-chain session switcher (`SessionsView`). Banner is
  persistent across views, help overlay (`?`) is generated from the central `keyboard-map.ts`.

### Removed

- The class-based use-case layer, the kernel module (chain primitives now live in
  `application/chain/`), and the `PersistencePort` monolith — replaced by per-aggregate repositories
  (`ProjectRepository`, `SprintRepository`, `SprintExecutionRepository`, `TaskRepository`).
- v1-only TUI dependencies: `@inkjs/ui`, `colorette`, `gradient-string`, `tabtab`. v0.7.0 ships a
  hand-rolled inline gradient renderer + Ink-native primitives.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- **Setup ≠ check.** Sprint start now runs each repo's configured `setupScript` (the deterministic
  baseline so Claude departs reliably) via the renamed `setup-scripts-sprint-start` chain leaf,
  iterating `sprint.affectedRepositories` and stamping `Sprint.setupRanAt[repoPath]`. Any setup
  failure — non-zero exit OR spawn-level error (missing binary, EPERM, ENOENT, …) — hard-aborts
  the chain as `InvalidStateError({ currentState: 'setup-failed' })` naming the failing repo. The
  per-task prompt's `{{ENVIRONMENT_STATUS}}` slot renders "Setup script ran at <ISO>" instead of
  the old "Pre-task environment check passed at" string.
- **Sprint resume skips already-stamped repos.** The `setup-scripts-sprint-start` leaf no-ops per
  repo when `Sprint.setupRanAt[repoPath]` already carries a timestamp, so a sprint killed mid-run
  reaches the per-task fan-out without re-running setup. The existing stamp is preserved.
- **Per-task `checkScript` is auto-sourced.** A new `resolve-check-scripts` chain leaf (runs in the
  initialize phase before setup) walks the sprint's project once and populates `ctx.checkScripts`
  with each affected repo's configured `Repository.checkScript`. The per-task bridge seeds the gate
  per-task without the user passing `--check-script`. The CLI flag stays as a global override
  (and its help text now says so).
- `execution/<unit-slug>/` slimmed: dropped per-unit `tasks.json` and `prior-evaluations/`; sibling
  evaluator output now renders inline inside `tasks.md`.

### Fixed

- **Per-task verification gate is a hard fence.** `PostTaskCheckUseCase` returns
  `Result.error(CheckFailedError)` on a non-zero exit. The per-task chain wraps it in
  `OnError(catchIf: code === 'check-failed')` and transitions the task to `'blocked'` (reason:
  "post-task check failed") instead of letting `mark-done` proceed.
- **Per-task spawn-level errors degrade gracefully.** The post-task `checkScript` gate, the
  execution-unit builder, and the evaluator each wrap their inner leaf in a soft `OnError` that
  absorbs anything except `aborted` and the gate's own hard error code, so a missing binary /
  EPERM doesn't strand a task. `resolve-check-scripts` runs before the setup leaf so the per-task
  gate keeps its check-script map even when sprint-start setup hard-aborts.
- **Legacy `sprint.json` files load.** Sprint files written by v0.6.2 (carrying `checkRanAt: {}`
  with no `setupRanAt` key) parse successfully; the legacy key is silently dropped on the next
  save, so the file self-cleans without a migration step.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-04

Hotfix on top of 0.6.1. The previous bundles silently no-op'd when invoked through the npm-installed
`ralphctl` shim — so `npm i -g ralphctl && ralphctl --version` exited 0 with no output.

### Fixed

- `entrypoint.ts#shouldAutoInvoke` no longer rejects symlinked bins. The basename allowlist
  (`cli.mjs` / `entrypoint.ts`) skipped `main()` when `process.argv[1]` was the npm-global
  `<prefix>/bin/ralphctl` symlink. Replaced with the canonical "am I the entry module?" check —
  resolve `argv[1]` through `realpathSync` and compare against `import.meta.url`. Added an e2e
  regression that spawns `dist/cli.mjs` through a renamed symlink and asserts on the version output.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-04

Quality follow-up to 0.6.0 — bumps the build chain to TypeScript 6, lifts a runtime patch on `zod`, and
deflakes a CI race in the ticket-add view test that intermittently failed on slower runners.

### Changed

- `pnpm update --latest` — TypeScript 5.9.3 → 6.0.3, `zod` 4.3.6 → 4.4.3, `typescript-eslint` 8.59.0 →
  8.59.2, `eslint` 10.2.1 → 10.3.0, `knip` 6.9.0 → 6.11.0, `globals` 17.5.0 → 17.6.0
- `tsconfig.json` — drop the now-deprecated `baseUrl` and root `paths` at `./` (TS 6 promoted the
  `baseUrl` deprecation to a hard error; `paths` resolves relative to `tsconfig.json` since TS 5.0)

### Fixed

- `ticket-add-view` test no longer races the React render cycle on CI. The frame-text assertion is now
  folded into the same `vi.waitFor` that watches the confirm-mock count, closing the gap that let CI
  snapshot a `Starting…` frame before the second-add success card had rendered.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **5-module Clean Architecture** (kernel / domain / business / integration / application) with strict ESLint
  layer fences
- **Kernel chain framework** — Element / Leaf / Sequential / Retry / OnError + ChainRunner runtime; five
  primitives, no concurrent fan-out (a `forEachItem`-shaped primitive is deferred until a second consumer
  materialises)
- **Multi-chain SessionManager** — N chains run concurrently; Tab cycles, Ctrl+1..9 jumps;
  foreground/background detaches without killing
- **Chain definitions:** refine, plan, ideate, execute, evaluate, feedback, **create-pr** (new),
  **onboard** (extended interview mode — setup + verify + CLAUDE.md + skill suggestions)
- **Sandbox workspaces for refine / plan / evaluator** — refine and plan AI sessions run in dedicated
  `<sprintDir>/workspaces/{refine,plan}/` sandboxes instead of hijacking the user's first repo. Affected
  repos are exposed via `--add-dir` (Claude) or mirrored under `workspaces/<phase>/repos/` (Copilot). The
  evaluator (and its fix-loop) gets a `<sprintDir>/workspaces/evaluate/` contract pack with refined
  requirements, full task plan, project context, dimension definitions, and prior sibling task evaluations —
  refreshed per round. Workspaces persist as durable debugging artefacts.
- `WorkspaceBuilderPort` (`src/business/ports/workspace-builder-port.ts`) with four methods:
  `buildRefineWorkspace`, `buildPlanWorkspace`, `buildEvaluateWorkspace`, `refreshEvaluateWorkspace`;
  `FileWorkspaceBuilderAdapter` is the implementation
- New chain leaves: `build-refine-workspace`, `build-plan-workspace`, `build-evaluate-workspace`
- `render-prompt-to-file` leaf — renders the full prompt template with all placeholders filled, asserts no
  `{{TOKEN}}` remains, writes to `<sprintDir>/contexts/<flow>-<id>.md`, and hands the AI a thin wrapper
  pointing at that file. Inserted into execute (per-task), feedback, and other AI-spawning flows.
- `WriteContextFilePort` (`src/business/ports/write-context-file-port.ts`) + `FileWriteContextFileAdapter`
  (`src/integration/persistence/file-write-context-file-adapter.ts`) — dedicated port for writing context
  files to the sprint working directory; replaces the ad-hoc file writes previously embedded in use cases
- `resolve-branch` leaf in `executeFlow` — prompts keep / auto / custom on first run when no branch is set,
  validates, persists via `Sprint.setBranch()`, and creates the branch in every unique `task.projectPath`;
  skips silently on resume
- `dirty-tree-preflight` leaf in `executeFlow` — detects uncommitted changes before check scripts run;
  user chooses stash / hard-reset / cancel
- `summarise-execution` leaf in `executeFlow` — emits a structured completion summary after `unlink-skills`
- `detect-existing-files` + `confirm-start-ai` leaves in `onboardFlow` — inspect the repo for a prior
  project context file and confirm with the user before launching the AI inventory session
- `load-tasks` step in `feedbackFlow` — loads the completed task list so the AI receives full context
- **Dependency-aware execute dashboard** — `<TaskExecutionList />` renders depth-indented per-task cards
  (status pill, activity line, depends-on line, blocked reason); `dag-depth.ts` provides the shared
  topological BFS ordering; `<TaskExecutionGrid />` is a thin wrapper that adds the section header
- `onCtxUpdate` callback on `Element.execute` — `ChainRunner` exposes live `.ctx` between steps so the
  TUI execute view can populate the task list without waiting for the chain to settle. All four primitives
  (Leaf, Sequential, Retry, OnError) thread the callback transparently
- `Task.resetToTodo()` — resets a stale `in_progress` task back to `todo`; used by the
  `reset-stale-in-progress` leaf in `executeFlow` to recover tasks left open by a prior crash
- **Per-phase skills bundles** — `BundledSkillsCopier` installs the union of `default/` and `<phase>/`
  (refine / plan / exec) into `<cwd>/.claude/skills/`. Project-authored skills always win — same-named
  bundled skills are skipped at install and never removed at uninstall. Per-cwd install manifest tracks
  only what was copied so uninstall doesn't `rm -rf` the user's tree
- `mark-blocked` task status with reason
- Multi-round evaluator fix loop with plateau detection
- Live config read per task settlement
- Progressive chain trace (subscribers receive `step` events as they happen)
- Persistent banner across all views; help overlay as modal takeover; prompt transcript above active prompt
- Pipeline map on home with bright "Next step" quick-action; tiered browse menu
  (Sprint / Ticket / Task / Project drill-ins)
- Schema-driven settings panel
- Doctor view + onboarding-status check + log path surfacing
- Shell tab-completion (bash / zsh / fish) with COMP\_\* intercept
- `sprint progress` (with health folded in) + `sprint requirements` + `sprint context` exports
- `Repository.setupScript` + `onboardedAt` fields; `Sprint.pullRequestUrl`
- Storage layout: `~/.ralphctl/{config,data,cache,logs,backups}/`
- First-launch wizard — bare `ralphctl` on a fresh install routes the user straight to project-add with
  a welcome card; non-TTY surfaces a friendly hint instead of help noise
- Legacy-layout detector at boot — refuses to start on a 0.5.x `~/.ralphctl/` and prints back-up
  instructions, since the on-disk schema is incompatible

### Changed

- Read version from `package.json` at build time (was hardcoded)
- Repository interfaces moved to domain layer; service ports stay in business
- Per-aggregate repositories (`SprintRepository` / `ProjectRepository` / `TaskRepository`) replace the
  monolithic `PersistencePort`
- **Execute flow runs strictly sequentially** — `executeFlow` uses a `Sequential` of topologically-ordered
  per-task chains; tasks execute one at a time in dependency order
- **Execute prompt consolidated** — task data is inlined in the rendered prompt file; the legacy two-file
  split (task context + prompt) is gone, `WriteTaskContextUseCase` removed
- CLI `--branch <name>` flag split into `--branch` (boolean, auto-generate `ralphctl/<sprint-id>`) and
  `--branch-name <name>` (custom name); both pre-seed `sprint.branch` so the `resolve-branch` leaf skips
  its prompt
- Evaluator `OnError` passes through `code: 'aborted'` — Ctrl+C mid-evaluator no longer swallows the
  cancel and silently marks the task done
- `EvaluateAndFixLoopUseCase` accepts optional `addDirs`, `evaluateSessionCwd`, `evaluateWorkspaceDir`,
  and `refreshWorkspace` — the standalone `sprint evaluate` chain leaves them undefined and runs unchanged
- Plan task-id parser accepts placeholder strings; the harness mints the real `TaskId` and resolves
  `blockedBy` through a placeholder→id map. Eliminates "task id must be 8 lowercase hex characters" and
  "depends on unknown task" errors when the AI emits friendly local ids
- Plan / ideate downstream guards — task `projectPath` and `ticketId` are validated against the sprint's
  affected repositories and tickets at parse time; empty task lists error at parse time

### Fixed

- **Plan no longer drops `.claude/skills/` into the user's first repo** — the `repos[0] ?? opts.cwd` bug
  is fixed; skills now land in the sandbox workspace

### Removed

- Legacy 4-module `src/` layout
- Pipeline framework (replaced by kernel chain framework)
- Daemon process registry + `sprint list-runs` / `attach` / `stop` / `why` (intentional cut)
- `sprint insights`, agents-md linter, version-check, completion handlers (legacy)

### Breaking

- `~/.ralphctl/` schema is incompatible with 0.5.x — see migration note in README

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Evaluator fix-loop now actually fixes things** — failed evaluations resume the
  generator session via `--resume <session-id>` (Anthropic's recommended
  generator-evaluator pattern) and deliver the full fix protocol from
  `task-evaluation-resume.md` instead of a 4-line hardcoded string. The loop no
  longer early-bails when the generator omits `<task-complete>`, and the final
  re-eval is skipped on the last iteration — saving a multi-minute spawn per
  failing task. Failure logs now report the actual iteration count rather than
  the configured cap.

### Changed

- **Evaluator option types collapsed** — pipeline `EvaluateOptions` folded into
  domain `EvaluationOptions` + a `force` flag; `generatorSessionId` /
  `generatorModel` relay fields removed from `EvaluateContext`. Evaluator-spawn
  and generator-resume now share a single `spawnOrNull` helper for error
  handling.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Check-script output no longer truncated mid-build** — the lifecycle hook
  now streams stdout/stderr into a 50 MB buffer instead of relying on
  `spawnSync`'s silent 1 MB cap, so real builds (`mvn`, large test suites)
  surface the actual failure instead of a spurious "check failed".
- **Failure reason surfaces in the execute view** — the per-task failure
  card now carries the underlying `StepError` (message + step name) and
  pins above the keyboard hints; the log tail auto-sizes to the terminal
  height. Check-script errors render the **last** lines of output, where
  build tools actually report failures.
- **Lifecycle hook timeouts now kill the whole process tree** — spawning
  with `detached: true` and signalling `-pid` ensures grandchildren
  spawned by `sh -c` (e.g. `sleep`) are reaped on Linux instead of
  holding stdio open and hanging the close handler.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-04-24

### Fixed

- **Version-check cache TTL reduced from 24h to 1h** — update notifications now
  surface the same day a release lands on npm rather than up to a day later.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Running-executions view + backgrounding** — TUI gains a router destination listing active
  sprint executions with status, elapsed time, and current activity. `Esc` from an execute view
  now backgrounds the run instead of tearing it down; the run keeps progressing and can be
  re-attached or cancelled from the list. A completion banner surfaces finished backgrounded
  runs next time the user lands on home.
- **`ExecutionRegistry` port + per-execution scope** — in-memory adapter tracks every live
  `ExecuteTasksUseCase` invocation with its own `SignalBus` scope, so dashboards, notification
  banners, and the running-executions view share one source of truth without leaking subscribers
  across runs.
- **`AbortSignal` plumbing through the scheduler** — cancellation propagates from the registry
  through `forEachTask`, the per-task pipeline, and the AI session adapter. New `cancelled`
  terminal variants distinguish user-initiated stops from errors in `stopReason`, task status,
  and signals.
- **Interactive dirty-tree handling on sprint resume** — when `sprint start` finds uncommitted
  changes in a sprint repo, the harness now runs a two-step Y/n prompt (`Resume with existing
changes? [Y/n]` → `Reset to latest commit and resume? [Y/n]`) instead of hard-blocking.
  Non-interactive contexts still block by default and surface a hint naming both new override
  flags: `--resume-dirty` (keep changes intact) and `--reset-on-resume` (discard tracked
  modifications + untracked files, then resume). The two flags are mutually exclusive.
- **`RemovalWorkflow` component** — shared state machine + surface for destructive flows (sprint
  delete, project / repo / ticket / task remove). Replaces five near-identical view
  implementations.

### Changed

- **Sprint delete is now single-confirm** — the former two-step "Are you sure? / Really sure?"
  chain collapses into one confirmation citing the destructive detail (ticket + task counts).
- **Global hotkeys fire from every view** — `h` / `s` / `d` / `?` / `q` / `Esc` now dispatch
  consistently from browse detail views (ticket-show, task-show, …) where child `useInput`
  handlers could previously mask them. Dispatch extracted into a `useGlobalKeys()` hook installed
  from every `<ViewShell>`.
- **Evaluator is stricter about rubber-stamping** — `task-evaluation.md` now requires a concrete
  per-dimension observation before `<evaluation-passed>`; bare `**Correctness**: PASS` lines
  without a justification parse as `status: failed`. Existing sprints may see more `failed`
  evaluation outcomes by design; the fix-and-reeval loop handles them like any other real failure.
- **Prompt guardrail against sprint-local identifiers** — `task-execution.md` and
  `sprint-feedback.md` now instruct the implementer to describe invariants directly rather than
  citing ephemeral sprint metadata (`AC1`–`AC6`, ticket / task / sprint IDs) in committed code.

### Fixed

- **Cancellation actually kills the subprocess and drains `in_progress`** — aborting a run via
  the running-executions view or `Ctrl+C` now terminates the spawned AI CLI immediately and
  resets any `in_progress` tasks back to `todo` so the next resume starts from a clean state.
  Cross-sprint + cross-project concurrency is pinned by a new regression fence.
- **Plan import preserves `verificationCriteria` and `extraDimensions`** — re-plan rounds no
  longer strip planner-emitted grading contracts when an existing task is reused, keeping the
  evaluator's rubric intact across iterations.

### Removed

- **`.claude/docs/PROMPT-AUDIT.md`** — the doc's invariants are now enforced as assertions in
  `src/integration/ai/prompts/loader.test.ts` (canonical XML vocabulary, TUI/CLI surface parity,
  generic-content audits) and summarised inline in `CLAUDE.md § Prompt Template Engineering`.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- **`ralphctl project onboard <name>` (#77)** — AI-assisted per-repo bootstrapping of the
  provider-native project context file (`CLAUDE.md` for Claude, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  for Copilot) plus a check-script suggestion. Pipeline-backed (`load-project → select-repo →
repo-preflight → ai-inventory → validate-agents-md → retry-agents-md-on-violation → check-drift
→ review-and-confirm → write-artifacts → verify-check-script`) with structural lint + one-shot
  retry on violation. Three auto-detected modes: `bootstrap`, `adopt` (authored file — proposal
  only, never overwrites), and `update` (prior `onboardingVersion` marker — diff with `<changes>`
  rationale). `--dry-run` surfaces the proposal without writing; `--auto` skips review. Full TUI
  parity via `ProjectOnboardView` — reachable from the home project submenu.
- **Per-repo onboarding row in `doctor` (#77)** — reports pass / warn / skip for each
  (project, repo) based on `onboardingVersion`, the provider-native file's presence, and
  `LOW-CONFIDENCE:` markers. Skips cleanly when no AI provider is configured. Doctor view
  rerendered with section blocks + per-section column alignment; hints prefixed with `ralphctl`
  for copy-paste.
- **AI-assisted check-script discovery (#76)** — when static heuristic detection finds nothing
  during `project add` / `project repo add`, a short AI session inspects the repo and proposes a
  check script via the `<check-script>` signal. Editable suggestion only — never a runtime
  fallback.

### Changed

- **README leads with the TUI** — new TUI screenshot + interactive quickstart up front; plain-text
  CLI is now framed as the non-TTY fallback rather than the primary surface.
- **Dev-dependency refresh** — bumped `vitest`, `eslint`, and `typescript-eslint` to current
  majors.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-20

### Changed

- **Prompt templates audited for downstream generality (#75)** — all 15 templates under
  `src/integration/ai/prompts/*.md` now follow a canonical XML vocabulary (`<context>`,
  `<requirements>`, `<constraints>`, `<examples>`, `<dimension>`, `<task-specification>`) per
  Anthropic's prompt-engineering guidance. Per-file audit report at `.claude/docs/PROMPT-AUDIT.md`.
- **De-Node-ified example JSON** — `{{CHECK_GATE_EXAMPLE}}` placeholder replaces hardcoded
  `pnpm`/`npm` strings so prompts render cleanly in Python / Go / Rust / Java downstream projects.
  Default now reads "omit this step when the project has no check script" so planners don't push
  a check-gate criterion on projects without one.
- **`plan-common.md` trimmed 263 → 197 lines** — illustrative good/bad JSON + dependency-graph
  examples extracted into a new `plan-common-examples.md` partial wrapped in `<examples>` to signal
  non-normativity. Savings compound across four inlined planner prompts.

### Added

- **`<thinking>` scratchpad in headless planners** — `plan-auto` and `ideate-auto` now direct the
  planner to reason in `<thinking>…</thinking>` before emitting JSON. Evidence-backed CoT lift;
  the JSON extractor already skips pre-bracket content, so no parser work needed.
- **CI-locked anti-patterns in `loader.test.ts`** — no `ralphctl` string in any template, no
  hardcoded subagent names, no literal package-manager commands outside the placeholder seam.
  TUI-parity fixture asserts byte-identical output across callers.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Dirty-tree leaks after task settlement** — tasks and end-of-sprint feedback iterations could
  leave uncommitted changes in the repo if the generator skipped its commit step. Two-layer fix:
  - `sprint-feedback` prompt now mandates a commit before completion; `task-evaluation` prompt
    declares a read-only posture and requires a clean tree in Phase 1.
  - New `recover-dirty-tree` pipeline step (between `evaluate-task` and `mark-done`) and matching
    hook in the feedback loop. If the tree is still dirty at settlement, the harness warns, emits
    a `Note` signal to `progress.md`, and auto-commits via a new `ExternalPort.autoCommit`.
    Non-blocking — `mark-done` always runs, even if the auto-commit itself fails.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-19

### Added

- **`ralphctl next`** + **`ralphctl task why`** — explain the next recommended action and a task's
  rationale; surfaced via the REPL task submenu.
- **Auto mode for refine + plan** — `--auto` flag (and matching REPL toggle) on `sprint refine` and
  `sprint plan` runs the AI loop without HITL approval prompts.
- **Loop ticket add (TUI)** — Ink `ticket add` view now prompts "Add another?" after each save and
  reports the running count, matching the plain-text CLI.
- **Scrollable confirm details** — the requirements approval prompt's bordered details block is now
  viewport-sized; ↑/↓ scroll one line, PgUp/PgDn paginate, with a `lines N–M of T` indicator.
- **Live refine overview** — `RefinePhaseView` polls the sprint while the pipeline runs so the
  approved/pending counters and per-ticket badges update as each ticket settles.
- **Live execution grid** — `ExecuteView` re-reads persisted tasks on every `task-finished` signal so
  the progress counter and per-task statuses tick during the run.
- **Per-step trace** — new `task-step` `HarnessEvent` is emitted around every per-task pipeline step
  (`branch-preflight`, `contract-negotiate`, `mark-in-progress`, `execute-task`, `store-verification`,
  `post-task-check`, `evaluate-task`, `mark-done`). The dashboard surfaces a labeled spinner per
  running task above the Log section ("Running Claude…", "Evaluating…", …) and mirrors the label as
  the task's row activity.

### Fixed

- Removed the duplicate `Completed: <task>` log line that was emitted by both the scheduler's
  `onSettle` callback and the `mark-done` step. The pipeline step now owns it.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Inline requirements preview** in `sprint refine` — the refined requirements are now shown as a bordered
  quote-rail block above the approval prompt so the user reviews the actual content before approving.
- **Live execute log** — the bottom log tail in `sprint start` renders the active spinner with live braille
  frames instead of a static glyph; resolved spinners collapse to a check/cross.
- **Auto-refreshing dashboard** — Home and Dashboard subscribe to the signal bus and reload data
  (throttled 500ms) during a running sprint, so task-started / task-finished / per-task signals tick the
  UI without a manual refresh.
- **Multi-line feedback editor** — the end-of-sprint feedback loop now uses the Claude-style inline editor
  (markdown, Ctrl+D submits, Esc cancels) instead of single-line input.
- **Task-like feedback iterations** — each feedback round now runs as a synthetic `Task` per affected repo:
  emits `task-started` / `task-finished` to the signal bus, routes parsed progress / note / blocked signals
  to the durable signal handler, and gates through the same post-task check script used for real tasks.
  The live dashboard animates feedback work the same way it animates regular tasks.
- **`truncate()` domain utility** (`src/domain/strings.ts`) — unifies the five hand-rolled clipping sites and
  fixes the `…` vs `...` inconsistency.

### Changed

- **Task-sizing prompt** — rewrote to emphasize coherence over line count. Explicit "do not split" /
  "do split" lists, a soft ~10-files / ~500-lines ceiling, and a task-count directive that lets scope drive
  the number rather than targeting 5–15.
- **Evaluator-resume prompt** — adds a "pivot when the critique is structural" clause so the resumer can
  replace a wrong approach instead of repeatedly patching it on related grounds. Default remains minimal fix.

### Fixed

- Suppressed the spurious "Reached maximum feedback iterations" warning that fired on clean empty-feedback
  exit.
- Hoisted `getTasks()` + repo-path resolution out of the feedback loop (was N+1 across iterations).
- Memoized the `resolvedIds` Set in `LogTail` — previously rebuilt from the full events array on every
  ~16ms render during execution.
- Shortened the over-long rejected-requirements warning in `sprint refine`.
- Dropped the fragile content-hash React key in `ConfirmPrompt`'s details block.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Housekeeping

- Pruned dead code across the theme, prompts, runtime, and factories layers: deleted unused formatters
  (`showInfo`, `printSummary`, `formatMuted`, `renderColumns`, `renderProgressSummary`), theme shortcuts
  (`warning`/`info`/`highlight`/`accent`/`primary`/`secondary`/`subtle` top-level re-exports and
  `colors.primary`/`colors.secondary`/`colors.subtle`), the never-wired `useLiveConfig` hook, the
  `PullQuote` component, the intermediate `editor.ts` wrapper, and the unused use-case + pipeline
  factory re-exports (`createRefineUseCase`, `createPlanUseCase`, `createIdeateUseCase`,
  `createEvaluateUseCase`, `createEvaluatorPipeline`, `createPerTaskPipeline`). `factories.ts` now
  exports only the four pipeline factories CLI and TUI actually call.
- Renamed `spawnHeadlessRaw` → `spawnHeadless` — the `Raw` suffix was vestigial after its wrapper was
  deleted.
- Added `FilesystemPort.getIdeationDir(sprintId, ticketId)` + the matching `paths.ts` helper; fixed a
  forgotten migration where `plan.ts` hardcoded the ideation directory path.
- Tightened the export surface — made ~55 prompt/view prop and option types private to their modules.
- Removed error classes that had no remaining call sites: `NotFoundError`, `TaskStatusError`,
  `ProviderError`.

### ⚠ BREAKING

- **Sprints are now scoped to a single project.** Sprint carries a `projectId`; tickets and tasks inherit
  project context. All cross-entity references use IDs instead of slug names. Old sprints missing
  `projectId` need a manual migration — there is no compatibility shim in this release. Rationale: the
  previous slug-based coupling silently broke when project names changed, and cross-project sprints were
  never a supported workflow in practice.

### Added

- **Composable pipelines.** Every user-triggered workflow (refine, plan, ideate, evaluate, execute) is now
  a composable `PipelineDefinition` under `src/business/pipelines/`. Framework primitives —
  `step` / `pipeline` / `nested` / `forEachTask` / `insertBefore` / `insertAfter` / `replace` / `renameStep` —
  live in `src/business/pipelines/framework/`; shared steps in `src/business/pipelines/steps/`. An ESLint
  fence blocks CLI / TUI from calling use cases directly.
- **Ink TUI.** Bare `ralphctl`, `ralphctl interactive`, and `ralphctl sprint start` mount a full-screen Ink
  application that takes over the terminal (alt-screen buffer, restored on exit). Includes: pipeline map
  Home, per-phase detail views, live execution dashboard, settings panel (`s`), global doctor hotkey (`?`),
  browse views for every entity with housekeeping CRUD, first-run onboarding wizard, npm version hint with
  24h cache, inline multi-line editor (Claude Code-style), sprint-show hub with per-sprint surfaces.
- **PromptPort + InkPromptAdapter.** One abstraction for every interactive prompt. Auto-mounts a minimal
  `<PromptHost />` for one-shot CLI commands; non-TTY environments throw `PromptCancelledError`.
- **LoggerPort with three sinks.** `PlainTextSink` (TTY one-shot CLI), `JsonLogger` (non-TTY / CI —
  one JSON object per line), `InkSink` (routes through the Ink event bus when mounted).
- **Structured harness signals.** Fixed discriminated union in `src/domain/signals.ts`
  (`ProgressSignal` / `EvaluationSignal` / `TaskCompleteSignal` / `TaskVerifiedSignal` / `TaskBlockedSignal` /
  `NoteSignal`). Adding a signal variant is a compile-time-enforced code change. `InMemorySignalBus`
  micro-batches emissions at ~16ms so the dashboard re-render stays smooth.
- **Config schema as single source of truth.** All keys defined in `src/domain/config-schema.ts` with type,
  default, description, and validation. `doctor`, `config show`, `config set`, and the Ink settings panel
  are all schema-driven — adding a key is a single edit.
- **Live config mid-execution (REQ-12).** `ExecuteTasksUseCase.getEvaluationConfig()` reads config fresh on
  every task settlement. Editing `evaluationIterations` in the settings panel during a run applies to the
  next task with no restart.
- **Per-task sprint contracts** written to `<sprintDir>/contracts/<taskId>.md` — a stable grading surface
  the evaluator references instead of re-deriving expectations from prompts.
- **Evaluator plateau detection** — short-circuits the eval loop when a critique stops improving between
  iterations.
- **Session-id resume across rate-limit pauses** — running task keeps its full context when the provider
  restarts.
- **Per-task evaluator dimensions** — four floor dimensions on every task (Correctness / Completeness /
  Safety / Consistency) plus planner-emitted `extraDimensions` for non-default success criteria
  (e.g. Performance, Accessibility).
- **Branch management.** `sprint start` prompts for branch strategy on first run; `--branch` auto-generates
  `ralphctl/<sprint-id>`; `--branch-name` for custom names; per-repo pre-flight verification;
  `sprint close --create-pr` opens PRs for sprint branches.
- **Management hotkeys on list + detail views** for tickets, tasks, sprints, and projects. Task-status
  hotkey renamed `s` → `t` to free `s` for the global settings panel.

### Changed

- **Clean Architecture.** Codebase now has four inward-pointing layers: `domain` (pure models,
  errors, signals) ← `business` (use cases + every port under `src/business/ports/`) ←
  `integration` (adapters, UI, 3rd-party glue) ← `application` (composition root). Every port has a single
  adapter under `src/integration/`. Use cases return `Result<T, DomainError>`; no throws at the boundary.
- **Claude provider defaults to `--effort xhigh`** for Opus 4.7 plans. Lower effort levels are mapped down
  for older models.
- **Prompts aligned with Opus 4.7's literal interpretation** — every template (`task-execution`,
  `task-evaluation`, `task-evaluation-resume`, `plan-auto`, `plan-interactive`, `ideate`, `ideate-auto`,
  `ticket-refine`, `sprint-feedback`) and the shared partials were rewritten to flip residual negatives
  and eliminate ambiguity. Check-script and Project Tooling context are now threaded into both the
  task-execution and evaluator prompts.
- **Evaluator model ladder** — pinned opus-4-7 → sonnet; documented the full ladder
  (Opus→Sonnet, Sonnet→Haiku, Haiku→Haiku for Claude; Copilot spawns without model override).
- **Rate-limit coordinator** lives behind the `SharedDeps` factory so executor and evaluator share one
  coordinator. New task launches pause globally when any task hits a rate limit.
- **TUI design system.** All views compose through `ViewShell` + `useViewHints` — consistent spacing,
  borders, and hotkey hints. Hardcoded glyphs / spacing / colors swept out of components in favour of
  theme tokens.
- **Source tree restructure — one home per concept.** Collapsed `src/business/pipeline/` (singular) into
  `src/business/pipelines/framework/`. Moved `src/domain/repositories/` into `src/business/ports/` so
  every interface business logic depends on lives in one folder. Carved `src/integration/ai/`'s 20-file
  dump into `session/`, `output/`, `prompts/`, `providers/`. Unified all interactive-prompt UI under
  `src/integration/ui/prompts/`. Merged the split `ui/theme/` + `ui/tui/theme/` directories. Drained
  `src/integration/utils/` to its logical homes (`ids` → domain, `exit-codes` → application,
  `detect-scripts` → external). Hoisted one-file directories into flat adapter files. Deleted dead
  `multiline.ts`. Moved `lifecycle.ts` (shell-exec for checkScripts) from `ai/` to `external/`.
- **No barrel files.** Every import points to its source module directly.
- **Full-screen responsive TUI** — dropped the content-width cap.
- **Settings panel is the single configuration entry** — redundant `config set` TUI surface removed.

### Fixed

- `SelectPrompt` commits the highlighted row, not the stale default.
- Router hotkeys disable while a prompt is pending.
- Arrow keys cycle through every phase in the pipeline map.
- Spinner no longer leaks through prompts.
- Plan/ideate plain-text output no longer bleeds into the Ink alt-screen.
- Close-phase Enter pops back when the sprint is already closed.
- `useViewHints` infinite render loop broken.
- Banner pinned to router shell (stops stale-closure refine fallthrough); content column recentered;
  gradient + quote memoized per mount.
- `sprint-feedback` prompt rewritten so user feedback actually lands in the AI session.
- AI provider resolved lazily before sync getters.

### Removed

- Legacy `ai/executor` + runner (unreachable after the pipeline migration).
- `src/interactive/` (superseded by the Ink TUI); `ora` dependency; every direct `@inquirer/prompts`
  import (now routed through `PromptPort`).
- Pre-generated JSON schema mirrors under `schemas/` — regenerate on demand from Zod.
- Dead `parallelMap` pipeline primitive and the `__services` magic context key.

### Documentation

- **Sequence diagrams split per pipeline.** Replaced the 260-line monolith `seq.puml` with
  `seq-refine.puml`, `seq-plan.puml`, `seq-ideate.puml`, `seq-evaluate.puml`, and `seq-execute.puml` —
  each 1:1 with a pipeline definition under `src/business/pipelines/`.
- **CLAUDE.md / ARCHITECTURE.md / REQUIREMENTS.md** rewritten to match the new shape. The step-order
  table in `ARCHITECTURE.md` links to the per-pipeline diagrams and covers every pipeline step.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-04-09

### Changed

- **Prompt templates consolidated into shared partials** — `harness-context`, `signals-task|planning|evaluation`,
  `validation-checklist`, and `plan-common` live as standalone `.md` files and are composed into each template at
  build time. Eliminates literal duplication across all 7 prompt templates; adding new shared content is now a
  one-line change (#61)
- **Strict `composePrompt()` contract** — Builder throws synchronously on any unreplaced `{{TOKEN}}` instead of
  silently rendering empty placeholders. Closes the silent-failure class called out in `CLAUDE.md` about missing
  substitutions (#61)
- **Target-project tooling threaded into planner and ideate prompts** — `sprint plan` and `sprint ideate` now surface
  the downstream project's `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/skills/`, `.mcp.json` servers, and instruction files with
  prescriptive delegation hints in generated task steps. Previously only the evaluator prompt (0.2.4) saw this.
  `implementer` and `planner` remain denylisted at detection time so the evaluator never delegates back to its own
  generator side (#61)
- **Prompt audit tests** — New per-template assertions enforce "prompts run in downstream projects — never hardcode
  ralphctl's own name or subagents" as test-as-documentation. Fails at CI time if a future template drifts (#61)

### Documentation

- **README refresh** — Surface branch-per-sprint workflow (`--branch`, `sprint close --create-pr`), the
  `sprint insights` command, and `evaluationIterations` tuning with the `--no-evaluate` single-run escape hatch —
  all shipped since the 0.2.2 README redesign but were never documented (#61)
- **ARCHITECTURE.md sync** — Drop phantom `Ticket.externalId` and `DuplicateTicketError`; add `Repository.checkTimeout`,
  `Task.verificationCriteria`, `Task.evaluationStatus`, `Task.evaluationFile`, the `evaluations/` sidecar directory,
  and the top-level `insights/` directory. Error-class table now reflects what's actually exported from
  `src/errors.ts` (#61)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Sidecar critique persistence** — Full untruncated evaluator critique persisted to
  `<sprintDir>/evaluations/<taskId>.md`, one entry per iteration. `tasks.json` keeps a 2000-char preview in
  `evaluationOutput`, the file path in `evaluationFile`, and a status discriminator in `evaluationStatus`
  (`'passed' | 'failed' | 'malformed'`). Bail cases (no `<task-complete>`, generator no-op, recheck failure) append
  self-explanatory stub entries so the trail is readable without cross-referencing executor stdout (#60)
- **Project tooling detection** — Evaluator prompt now surfaces installed `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/skills/`,
  `.mcp.json` servers, and instruction files (`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) with
  prescriptive delegation hints (`auditor` for security-sensitive diffs, `reviewer` for code quality, Playwright MCP
  for UI tasks). `implementer` and `planner` are denylisted at detection time so the evaluator never delegates back
  to its own generator side (#60)
- **Malformed evaluator status** — New `'malformed'` discriminator distinguishes "evaluator output had no parseable
  signal" from a real failure. The fix loop now bails before feeding garbage to the generator as a "critique" (#60)

### Changed

- **Evaluator participates in parallel rate-limit coordinator** — Waits during global pauses and triggers them on its
  own 429s, so generator tasks back off when the evaluator hits the wall first instead of stampeding into the same
  wall (#60)
- **Evaluator capped at 100 turns** — Lower than executor's 200; review work doesn't need a runaway budget (#60)
- **Evaluator spawn failures no longer crash the sprint** — `runEvaluation` calls are wrapped in a safe helper that
  converts errors to malformed results, matching the "evaluator never permanently blocks" contract documented in
  CLAUDE.md (#60)
- **`evaluationIterations` semantics clarified** — Now documented as "number of fix attempts after the initial
  evaluation". Default `1` = 1 initial eval + up to 1 fix-and-reeval round = at most 2 evaluator spawns. `0` disables
  evaluation entirely (#60)
- **Resume prompt extracted to template file** — Inline 7-line generator-resume prompt moved from `executor.ts` to
  `src/ai/prompts/task-evaluation-resume.md` so it can be reviewed alongside the other prompt templates (#60)

### Fixed

- **Sequential post-task check ignored per-repo `checkTimeout`** — Now correctly threaded into both `runLifecycleHook`
  and the evaluation loop's recheck. Parallel mode was already correct; only the sequential path was affected (#60)
- **No-op generator fix attempts now break the loop** — After a generator resume, the executor compares HEAD SHA and
  working-tree state; if neither changed, it bails instead of burning another evaluator spawn on the same critique
  (#60)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Verification criteria** — new `verificationCriteria` field on Task schema, surfaced in task context and evaluator
  prompt as the grading contract; JSON schemas (`tasks.schema.json`, `task-import.schema.json`) updated with sync tests
  (#57)
- **Evaluator dimension scoring** — structured PASS/FAIL parsing per dimension (correctness, completeness, safety,
  consistency) with per-dimension findings (#57)
- **Sprint insights** — new `sprint insights` command to analyze evaluation results and surface patterns across tasks
  (#57)

### Changed

- **Executor hardening** — `--max-turns` safety net (default 200), session ID tracking across evaluation iterations,
  correct model propagation on fix attempts (#57)
- **Prompt quality** — all 7 prompt templates rewritten per Anthropic's current best practices: toned down urgency
  language, added "why" explanations, XML structural tags, harness context (#57)
- **Documentation** — CLAUDE.md gains environment variables, build/distribution, and release sections; README adds
  reference links to Anthropic harness design articles
- Deduplicated console capture into shared `captureOutput` test helper

### Fixed

- Path traversal protection on ticket ID segments (#57)

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Redesigned README — new "Why ralphctl?" section, workflow diagram, features reframed as user benefits, collapsed CLI
  reference and provider comparison tables
- Improved 7 AI prompt templates — fixed `__tests__` rendering bug, added evaluator pass-bar guidance, clarified harness
  check behavior, added blocker handling to ideate-auto, softened prescriptive acceptance criteria wording
- Enhanced evaluation resume prompt with structured iteration steps and scope boundaries (aligned with Anthropic harness
  design patterns)

### Fixed

- Incorrect `dashboard` command reference in README (actual CLI command is `status`)
- Stale test comment claiming `.replace()` when code uses `.replaceAll()`; strengthened token replacement assertion

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- Evaluation resume prompt now instructs the generator to commit fixes, ensuring re-evaluation can see changes via
  `git diff`; respects `--no-commit` flag

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- **Generator-evaluator pattern** — autonomous code review after task completion with model ladder
  (Opus->Sonnet, Sonnet->Haiku, Haiku->Haiku); configurable `evaluationIterations`; `--no-evaluate` flag (#49)
- **Sprint ideation** — `sprint ideate` combines refine + plan in one session for quick ideas; auto-assigns ticketId;
  handles bare tasks array output (#51)
- **Budget and model controls** — `--max-budget-usd` and `--fallback-model` flags for `sprint start`
- **Per-repo check timeout** — configurable check script timeout per repository with failure isolation
- **Interactive config menu** — editor and evaluation iterations configurable from interactive mode

### Changed

- Rebranded from task management CLI to agent harness — updated description, README, and all documentation (#50)
- Achieved Copilot CLI parity with Claude Code provider (JSON output, session management, headless args) (#47)
- Provider-agnostic prompt templates and session routing through adapters
- Improved model name validation and provider handling security

### Fixed

- Stale sprint overwrite in ideation flow

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-14

### Changed

- Extracted `ensureError()` helper to eliminate duplicated inline error mapper pattern across 39 files (#44)
- Replaced `Result.try()` wrappers around `assertSprintStatus` with direct try/catch for clearer error handling (#44)
- `project.ts` now throws `ValidationError` (instead of generic `Error`) for path validation failures — errors display
  cleanly without stack traces (#44)
- Added unit tests for `result-helpers` (`wrapAsync`, `zodParse`, `unwrapOrThrow`, `ensureError`) (#44)
- Documented Result/throwing boundary convention in CLAUDE.md (#44)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed

- **Provider abstraction** — `config set provider claude|copilot` with adapter layer; experimental Copilot CLI support
  with headless execution and session ID capture
- **Draft re-plan** — running `sprint plan` on a draft with existing tasks passes all tickets + tasks as AI context for

  sprint start and as a post-task gate
- **Lifecycle hooks** — `runLifecycleHook()` abstraction in `src/ai/lifecycle.ts` with `RALPHCTL_LIFECYCLE_EVENT` env
  var
- **Ecosystem detection** — `EcosystemDetector[]` registry (node, python, go, rust, gradle, maven, makefile) for check
  script suggestions during project setup
