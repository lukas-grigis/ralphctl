# RalphCTL — Architecture

Function-first Clean Architecture with a chain-of-responsibility framework. For acceptance criteria, see
[REQUIREMENTS.md](./REQUIREMENTS.md). For the chain framework reference, see [KERNEL-DESIGN.md](./KERNEL-DESIGN.md).

## Why this shape

The application is structured as four strictly-layered modules. Use cases are plain functions
(`(props) => Promise<Result<Output, DomainError>>`) — no class instances, no constructor injection, no `this`.
Chains compose use cases into workflows; the chain framework is the orchestration layer, not business logic.

Every workflow ("flow") declares itself once in `src/application/registry.ts` as a `FlowManifest`. The CLI command
builder, the TUI menu, and the launch logic all consume from the same array. Adding a flow is one append — there
is no scattered index file or per-flow boilerplate fork.

## Module layout

```
src/
├── domain/        ← entities, value objects, errors, repository interfaces, signal types
├── business/      ← use cases (function factories) + observability + SCM + version ports
├── integration/   ← adapters: AI providers / prompts / signals / skills / readiness probes,
│                    persistence, observability sinks, SCM (gh/glab), version-check, IO helpers
└── application/   ← composition root, chain framework, flow registry + flows, runner + session,
                     CLI + Ink TUI
```

Strict layering — dependencies point one way:

```
application → integration → business → domain
```

Both `domain/` and `business/` are pure: they cannot import I/O-bearing `node:*` modules (`node:fs`,
`node:child_process`, `node:http`, …). Pure modules (`node:path`, `node:url`, `node:util`, `node:assert`,
`node:crypto`) are allowed. `integration/` is where I/O lives. `application/` is the only layer that may import
from anywhere.

ESLint `no-restricted-imports` (in `eslint.config.ts`) enforces every direction. The same config enforces:

- **No `class` outside `src/domain/value/error/`** — entities and use cases are interfaces + standalone functions.
- **No barrel files anywhere under `src/`** — every import names what it pulls in directly. `export *` is banned.
- **Sibling-isolation in `integration/ai/<concept>/`** — each per-tool / per-variant adapter directory is
  independent. Cross-sibling reach goes through a shared `_engine/` sub-namespace (or `_partials/` for prompts).
  Applies to `prompts/<flow>/`, `signals/<variant>/`, `providers/<tool>/`, `readiness/<tool>/`, `skills/<source>/`.
- **Port-shaped names live in `_engine/`** — interfaces / type aliases named `*Port`, `*Adapter`, `*Provider`,
  `*Sink`, `*Loader`, `*Probe`, `*Reader`, `*Writer`, `*Renderer`, `*Detector` must be declared in a concept's
  `_engine/` sub-namespace. Factory inputs named `*Deps` are exempt.
- **Business use cases consume slim sub-ports**, not composite `*Repository` interfaces. The composition root
  wires the composite to the use case as a slim port (`FindById`, `Save`, `Remove`, …) under
  `domain/repository/_base/`.
- **Sibling-isolation in `business/<module>/`** — each business sub-domain (`project`, `sprint`, `ticket`,
  `task`, `feedback`, …) is independent; cross-module sharing goes through `_engine/` or `_shared/`. The single
  universal cross-cutting exception is `business/observability/` — Logger and EventBus are infra-shaped ports
  every sibling consumes.
- **Sibling-isolation in `application/flows/<flow>/`** — flows compose port-level vocabulary only; bootstrap
  selects the concrete provider / probe / skill adapter. Meta-flows under `application/flows/_meta/` may import
  any sibling flow.
- **`*Output` types are the success-side data shape**, not the `Result` envelope. Use
  `Result<FooOutput, ErrorUnion>` in the function signature.

## Bounded contexts (aggregates)

| Aggregate root      | Sub-files on disk             | Repository interface        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Project**         | `projects/<id>.json`          | `ProjectRepository`         |
| **Sprint**          | `sprints/<id>/sprint.json`    | `SprintRepository`          |
| **SprintExecution** | `sprints/<id>/execution.json` | `SprintExecutionRepository` |
| **Task** (set)      | `sprints/<id>/tasks.json`     | `TaskRepository`            |
| **Settings**        | `config/settings.json`        | `SettingsRepository`        |

`Sprint` is split into three sibling on-disk files. `sprint.json` is the planning aggregate (tickets,
requirements, status, project reference). `execution.json` carries the runtime audit — branch name, PR URL,
per-repo setup-script timestamps. `tasks.json` is the canonical task list — the file the chain runner rewrites
on every settlement. The split keeps planning mutations isolated from execution-time writes; corrupting the task
list does not lose the sprint plan.

`Repository` is **nested inside `Project`** as a value object — not its own aggregate. Project carries an array
of repositories (each with `setupScript`, `checkScript`, `onboardedAt`); mutating a repo goes through
`ProjectRepository.save()`.

`Ticket` is nested inside `Sprint` (status flips `pending → approved` during refine).

## Chain framework

> Visual: [diagrams/01-chain-framework.md](./diagrams/01-chain-framework.md)

Five factory functions under `src/application/chain/`:

- `element.ts` — the `Element<TCtx>` interface every primitive implements. Carries `name`, optional `children`
  (for composite walk), and `execute(ctx, signal?, onTrace?): Promise<ElementResult<TCtx>>`.
- `build/leaf.ts` — `leaf(name, { useCase, input, output })`. The only seam to a business use case. `input`
  projects ctx → use-case input; `output` merges use-case output → new ctx.
- `build/sequential.ts` — `sequential(name, [elements])`. Threads ctx; aborts remaining on first failure.
- `build/loop.ts` — `loop(name, body, opts)`. Generator-evaluator primitive. `shouldContinue` (pre-iteration)
  and `shouldStop` (post-iteration) predicates exit naturally; `maxIterations` (default 1000) is a hard cap.
  Hitting the cap is an ok-return — callers distinguish budget exhaustion from natural termination via ctx.
- `build/guard.ts` — `guard(name, predicate, body)`. Skips the body when `predicate(ctx)` returns false; emits
  a `skipped` trace entry.

**No `retry` or `onError` decorators** — branching belongs inside a use case or a sub-chain the caller selects.
Retry on rate-limits is an adapter concern (`IterationConfig.rateLimitRetries` on the headless provider wrapper).

The `ChainRunner` (`src/application/chain/run/runner.ts`) wraps one `Element.execute()` call with a status
machine (`idle → running → completed | failed | aborted`) and an event stream
(`started | step | completed | failed | aborted`). Late subscribers added after a terminal state receive a
synthetic replay of every step entry plus the matching terminal event — UI re-attach is lossless. The trace is
ring-buffered at `MAX_TRACE_ENTRIES = 20_000` to bound the per-runner memory footprint on multi-task runs.

See [KERNEL-DESIGN.md](./KERNEL-DESIGN.md) for the full contract.

## Session scoping

`src/application/session/session.ts` wraps every chain execution in an `AsyncLocalStorage`-backed scope
(`runWithSession(sessionId, fn)`). Inside any async work spawned during the chain — including deep inside
provider adapters that don't know which chain they're in — `currentSessionId()` returns the owning chain's id.
The Logger and signal sink ports use this to tag every emitted record with the session, so the TUI can route
streams without explicit threading. Outside any chain (one-shot CLI commands, doctor checks),
`currentSessionId()` returns `undefined` and downstream consumers treat the stream as untagged.

## Use cases (`src/business/<module>/`)

Every business operation is a **function factory** with the shape:

```ts
const createDoFoo = (deps: DoFooDeps): UseCase<FooInput, FooOutput> => ({
  execute: async (input, signal?) => {
    /* ... */
  },
});
```

No class instances. The factory closes over its slim-port dependencies; the returned object has only `execute`.
Composition root constructs the factory at startup; chain leaves invoke `execute` via the `leaf` primitive.

## Ports

Service ports live under `business/<module>/` (one folder per cross-cutting concern). Repository interfaces live
in `domain/repository/<aggregate>/`.

| Port                                                  | Folder                              | Concrete adapter                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Logger` + `Sink`                                     | `business/observability/`           | `createEventBusLogger` (re-published as `LogEvent`)               |
| `EventBus`                                            | `business/observability/`           | `InMemoryEventBus` (`integration/observability/`)                 |
| `HeadlessAiProvider`                                  | `integration/ai/providers/_engine/` | `claude` / `copilot` / `codex` adapters under `providers/<tool>/` |
| `InteractiveAiProvider`                               | `integration/ai/providers/_engine/` | same per-tool adapters (interactive entrypoint)                   |
| `HarnessSignalSink`                                   | `integration/ai/signals/_engine/`   | file sinks under `integration/observability/sinks/`               |
| `TemplateLoader`                                      | `integration/ai/prompts/_engine/`   | `FsTemplateLoader` — dev: src tree, bundled: `dist/`              |
| `ReadinessProbe`                                      | `integration/ai/readiness/_engine/` | per-tool probes under `readiness/<tool>/`                         |
| `SkillsAdapter` + `SkillSource`                       | `integration/ai/skills/_engine/`    | per-tool adapter + bundled / project source                       |
| `GitRunner` / `ShellScriptRunner`                     | `integration/io/`                   | `createGitRunner` / `createShellScriptRunner`                     |
| `FileLocker` + `WriteFile`                            | `business/io/` + `integration/io/`  | `createFileLocker` / atomic write helper                          |
| `IssueFetcher` / `IssuePusher` / `PullRequestCreator` | `business/scm/`                     | `gh` / `glab` shell wrappers under `integration/scm/`             |
| `VersionChecker`                                      | `business/version/`                 | `createNpmVersionChecker` (`integration/version/`)                |

## Repository interfaces (`src/domain/repository/`)

Per-aggregate. Each composite repository declares the full CRUD surface but business code does not import it
directly — use cases depend on **slim sub-ports** under `domain/repository/_base/` so the dependency surface of
each use case is legible:

```ts
// domain/repository/_base/
interface FindById<Id, Entity> { findById(id: Id): Promise<Result<Entity | null, …>>; }
interface Save<Entity>         { save(entity: Entity): Promise<Result<void, …>>; }
interface Remove<Id>           { remove(id: Id): Promise<Result<void, …>>; }
// ...
```

A use case declares `Deps = { sprints: FindById<SprintId, Sprint> & Save<Sprint> }` and the composition root wires
the composite `SprintRepository` (which already satisfies both sub-interfaces) as that prop. ESLint blocks
business code from importing composite `*Repository` types.

Sibling-isolation: each aggregate's repository folder (`sprint/`, `task/`, `project/`, `settings/`) is independent;
shared abstractions live under `_base/`.

## Composition root

```
application/bootstrap/
├── wire.ts                ← createAppDeps via wire(opts: WireOptions): AppDeps
├── storage-paths.ts       ← resolveStoragePaths() + storagePathsFromRoot(absPath)
├── runtime-sinks.ts       ← AppSinks (HarnessSignalSink, …)
├── provider-factory.ts    ← createAiProvider({ ai, harnessConfig, eventBus, spawn? })
├── interactive-provider-factory.ts
└── config.ts              ← default settings + IterationConfig satisfies-check
```

`wire(opts)` returns the `AppDeps` graph — every concrete adapter, in one pure object. Tests construct one from
a tmpdir via `storagePathsFromRoot(tmpDir)` so no test ever touches `~/.ralphctl-v2/`. Production resolves real
paths via `resolveStoragePaths()` and calls `wire()` with them.

`AppDeps` is the type the typechecker uses to prove "every port the app needs is actually wired" at the bootstrap
boundary. Each flow declares its own slim `<Flow>Deps` interface that's a subset of `AppDeps` — reading a flow
factory's signature tells you exactly which ports the workflow depends on.

`AppDeps.eventBus` is a single in-memory bus per `wire()` call. Bus state isolates between concurrent app
instances. Adapters publish structured `AppEvent`s:

```ts
ChainStarted |
  ChainStepStarted |
  ChainStepCompleted |
  ChainStepFailed |
  ChainCompleted |
  ChainFailed |
  ChainAborted |
  TaskAttemptStarted |
  TaskAttemptEvaluated |
  FeedbackRoundApplied |
  LogEvent;
```

TUI panels subscribe; the persistent `<sprintDir>/chain.log` sink (`integration/observability/sinks/file-log-sink.ts`)
subscribes. The same bus is the fan-out point for any future telemetry adapter.

`AppDeps.logger` is created via `createEventBusLogger({ eventBus, clock: IsoTimestamp.now })` — every
`logger.info(...)` publishes a `LogEvent` AppEvent. Console sinks, file appenders, and TUI tail panels all
subscribe to the same stream.

## Flow registry (`src/application/registry.ts`)

> Visual: [diagrams/02-flow-lifecycle.md](./diagrams/02-flow-lifecycle.md)

The single source of truth for "what flows exist". Each entry is a `FlowEntry` carrying a `FlowManifest`:

```ts
interface FlowManifest {
  readonly id: string; // stable kebab-case identifier
  readonly title: string; // shown in TUI menu / CLI help
  readonly description: string;
  readonly canBackground: boolean;
  readonly triggers: FlowTriggers; // pre-launch readiness predicates
}
```

`FlowTriggers` declares the conjunction of conditions that gate a flow: `requiresProject`,
`currentSprintStatus`, `minPendingTickets`, `minApprovedTickets`, `minResumableTasks`. Empty triggers means
"always available". The TUI evaluates triggers against the current session state to enable / disable menu
entries and surface a human-readable hint when a flow isn't ready.

Concrete flow factories live next to the manifest in each flow folder (`src/application/flows/<flow>/`) and
are imported by the launcher (`application/ui/shared/launch/<flow>.ts`) or the CLI command
(`application/ui/cli/commands/<flow>.ts`).

### Flows and their nature

| Flow id                        | Shape    | CLI command                   | Notes                                               |

| `detect-scripts`               | chain    | no                            | Setup/check script discovery; TUI only              |
| `detect-skills`                | chain    | no                            | Skill discovery; TUI only                           |
| `implement`                    | chain    | no                            | Genuinely needs the chain (gen-eval + retry)        |
| `review`                       | chain    | no                            | Apply-feedback loop; TUI only                       |
| `close-sprint`                 | use-case | yes (`sprint close`)          | review → done transition                            |
| `export-context`               | use-case | yes                           | Render harness-context markdown                     |
| `export-requirements`          | use-case | yes                           | Render approved-ticket requirements markdown        |

| `doctor`                       | use-case | yes                           | Environment health check                            |
| `settings`                     | use-case | yes (`settings show` / `set`) | Per-key read/write                                  |
| `ticket-add` / `ticket-remove` | use-case | yes                           | Per `docs/api.md`                                   |

CLI surface is deliberately smaller than v0.6.x — the interactive chains stay TUI-only by design. See
`docs/api.md` (in this repo's docs at the v2 source) for flag-level detail on the CLI commands.

## Validation strategy

- **Value objects** (`src/domain/value/`) — branded types with smart constructors that return `Result<T, E>`.
  Instances are always valid. Examples: `SprintId`, `TaskId`, `TicketId`, `ProjectId`, `Slug`, `AbsolutePath`,
  `IsoTimestamp`. Zod is used inside the smart constructor where a format check helps; otherwise plain runtime
  predicates.
- **Entities** (`src/domain/entity/`) — trust their own invariants. No Zod inside `Sprint`, `Project`, `Task`,
  `Ticket`, `Repository`. Mutators return new instances; entities are structurally immutable.
- **Serialization boundary** — Zod schemas in `src/integration/persistence/<aggregate>/<aggregate>.schema.ts`
  validate JSON when reading/writing files. Round-trip type safety; on-disk corruption surfaces as a typed
  `ParseError`.
- **Settings boundary** — `src/domain/entity/settings.ts` declares the `SettingsSchema` Zod object; the
  persistence adapter reuses it for round-trip parsing. A malformed file surfaces as `ParseError`, not a
  half-decoded record. The schema carries `schemaVersion` for forward-migration when the on-disk shape changes.
- **External input boundary** — Zod for AI output parsing (`signals.json`, planning output).

## Result types

`Result<T, E>` and `AsyncResult<T, E>` come from `typescript-result`, but every consumer imports from
`src/domain/result.ts` — the canonical re-export point. The underlying library may only be imported by that one
file; ESLint enforces it.

Use cases return `Result<T, DomainError>`. Throws are reserved for programmer errors (e.g. ctx-shape violations
inside a leaf `input` / `output` projection). Persistence-layer functions may throw domain errors at the bottom
of the stack — the leaf or use-case wrapping them catches and converts to `Result`.

Path resolution lives in `src/application/bootstrap/storage-paths.ts` (`resolveStoragePaths`,
`storagePathsFromRoot`, `ensureStorageRoots`). On-disk path helpers for the sprint subtree live in
`src/integration/persistence/storage.ts`.

The `RALPHCTL_HOME` env var, when set to an absolute path, replaces the entire `<home>/.ralphctl-v2` prefix.
Used by integration tests that spawn real subprocesses, and by users who want a non-default data location.

Canonical entity shapes live in `src/domain/entity/<name>.ts` — immutable interfaces with `Result`-returning
smart constructors. Read the source for the field list; this section names each aggregate's identity, lifecycle,
and the non-obvious mutators.

- **`Project`** (`project.ts`) — identified by `ProjectId`; carries an array of `Repository` value objects (each
  with `setupScript`, `checkScript`, `checkTimeout`, `onboardedAt`).
- **`Sprint`** (`sprint.ts`) — identified by `SprintId`; lifecycle `draft → active → review → done`; carries
  `projectId`, nested `Ticket[]`, `affectedRepositories` (absolute paths). Mutators: `addTicket`, `refineTicket`,
  `removeTicket`, `planSprint(draft → planned)`, `activate`, `transitionToReview`, `transitionToDone`.
- **`SprintExecution`** (`sprint-execution.ts`) — identified by the parent `SprintId`; carries `branch`,
  `pullRequestUrl`, `setupRunAt` (map of repo path → ISO timestamp). Separate from `Sprint` so the
  runtime-mutating fields don't collide with planning writes.
- **`Ticket`** (nested inside `Sprint`) — identified by `TicketId`; `requirementStatus: pending → approved`
  flipped by the refine flow.
- **`Task`** (`task.ts`) — identified by `TaskId`; status `todo | in_progress | done | blocked`; references
  `Sprint` via `ticketId` and DAG edges via `blockedBy`. Carries an `attempts[]` history (one entry per
  generator-evaluator round) — each `Attempt` has `evaluation` + `verification` sub-records. Optional
  `extraDimensions` is the planner's per-task grading rubric beyond the four floor dimensions
  (Correctness / Completeness / Safety / Consistency). Optional `maxAttempts` overrides the global cap.
- **`Settings`** — declared by `SettingsSchema` in `domain/entity/settings.ts`. Top-level fields: `schemaVersion`,
  `ai: { provider, models }`, `harness: { maxTurns, maxAttempts, rateLimitRetries }`, `logging: { level }`,
  `concurrency: { maxParallelTasks }`. `ai.provider` is one of `'claude-code' | 'github-copilot' | 'openai-codex'`;
  `ai.models` is an object keyed by chain (`refine` / `plan` / `implement` / `readiness` / `ideate`).

## Harness Signals

Discriminated union declared at `src/domain/signal.ts`; one sibling parser per variant under
`src/integration/ai/signals/<variant>/`. The parser registry (`signals/_engine/registry.ts`) composes the
parsers; adding a variant requires editing the registry and adding a parser.

Adapter-side: each AI spawn writes a `signals.json` file the harness reads post-spawn. Replaces the brittle
stdout-parsing path; signals are now a structured contract, not a regex over CLI output.

| Signal                                   | Consumed by                                                                                                        |

EventBus events emitted by the chain runner (not parsed from AI output): `ChainStarted`, `ChainStepStarted`,
`ChainStepCompleted`, `ChainStepFailed`, `ChainCompleted`, `ChainFailed`, `ChainAborted`,
`TaskAttemptStarted`, `TaskAttemptEvaluated`, `FeedbackRoundApplied`, `LogEvent`.

## Error Classes

All domain errors extend `DomainError` (`src/domain/value/error/domain-error.ts`) and carry a machine-readable
`code` plus optional `cause`. The error class is one of the few legitimate places `class` is allowed.

| Class               | Folder                | Cause                                                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NotFoundError`     | `domain/value/error/` | Aggregate (project / sprint / ticket / task) not found by id           |
| `ConflictError`     | `domain/value/error/` | Uniqueness or cardinality violation (e.g. duplicate slug, repo path)   |
| `InvalidStateError` | `domain/value/error/` | Operation invalid for the entity's current status                      |
| `ValidationError`   | `domain/value/error/` | Smart-constructor or schema validation failed (carries `field`/`path`) |
| `ParseError`        | `domain/value/error/` | JSON / output parser rejection                                         |
| `StorageError`      | `domain/value/error/` | Read/write failure in the persistence layer                            |
| `RateLimitError`    | `domain/value/error/` | AI process rate-limited (wraps spawn outcome)                          |
| `AbortError`        | `domain/value/error/` | User-initiated cancellation; propagates through chains                 |
| `ProbeError`        | `domain/value/error/` | Readiness probe rejection                                              |

## Exit Codes

`src/application/ui/cli/exit-codes.ts`:

| Code | Constant           | Meaning                       |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 0    | `EXIT_SUCCESS`     | All operations completed      |
| 1    | `EXIT_ERROR`       | Validation or execution error |
| 130  | `EXIT_INTERRUPTED` | SIGINT received               |

## Terminal UI Layer (`src/application/ui/`)

Stock Ink + hand-rolled inline gradient renderer (no `@inkjs/ui`, no external gradient libraries). The TUI is
the primary surface — `ralphctl` with no args mounts the full app. CLI subcommands skip the Ink mount and run
against the bootstrap directly, emitting structured logs through the console sink.

```

│   ├── cli.ts                       ← Commander program builder
│   ├── bootstrap.ts                 ← wire() + sinks setup for one-shot commands

    ├── runtime/                     ← mount.tsx (alt-screen takeover) + use-event-bus.ts subscriber
    ├── theme/                       ← tokens.ts (single source of visual truth)

                                       Sessions, Execute, Welcome, browse/, crud/
```

The mount path enters the **alt-screen buffer** (`CSI ? 1049 h`) and hides the cursor so ralphctl takes over the
terminal like vim/htop/less. Restoration is guaranteed via explicit exit + `process.on('exit' | 'SIGINT' | 'SIGTERM' | 'SIGHUP' | 'uncaughtException')` safety nets.

Cross-cutting TUI features:

- **Persistent banner** + **help overlay** (`?`). The banner quote stabilises at module load so navigation
  doesn't jitter.
- **Centralised keyboard map** — all shortcuts in one table; the help overlay generates from the same source.
- **Multi-flow nav** — Tab / Shift+Tab cycle running flows, `Ctrl+1..9` direct-jump; `SessionsView` lists every
  runner with status + age.
- **Schema-driven settings panel** — rows iterate the `SettingsSchema`; the prompt kind is derived from value
  type. Edits save immediately.
- **Doctor view** — runs `runDoctor()` on mount; renders per-check status rows + an aggregate result card.
  `!` opens it from anywhere.

## Build & Distribution

Two-stage pipeline:

1. **`tsup`** compiles the TypeScript graph to `dist/cli.mjs`.
2. **`tsx scripts/build-assets.ts`** walks `src/integration/ai/prompts/<flow>/` and
   `src/integration/ai/skills/bundled/<name>/`, copies them into `dist/prompts/` and `dist/skills/`, and writes
   `dist/manifest.json` listing every staged asset.

Template / skill loading is dual-mode:

- **Dev (`tsx`)** — reads from `src/integration/ai/{prompts,skills}/`. `FsTemplateLoader` and `bundledSkillSource`
  detect mode via `import.meta.url`.
- **Bundled (`dist/cli.mjs`)** — reads from `dist/{prompts,skills}/`. Missing assets fail fast with a repair hint.

CI smoke-tests `node dist/cli.mjs --version` from arbitrary cwd plus a real `npm install` from the packed tarball.

## Future Work

- **Real-provider e2e** — every Claude / Copilot / Codex provider test uses a fake `spawn`. Vendor JSON-shape
  drift will surface here first. Same gap as v0.6.x; deferred.
- **Bundle-mode detection robustness** — `import.meta.url.endsWith('/cli.mjs')` would silently no-op if the
  published bin is renamed. Candidate replacement: `existsSync(<here>/manifest.json)`.
- **User-skill consumption** — `SkillSuggestionsSignal` is parsed but nothing consumes it yet. Out of scope
  for v0.7.0.
- **Concurrency > 1** — `settings.concurrency.maxParallelTasks` is wired but the implement chain still runs
  strictly sequential. Concurrent per-task fan-out needs a new chain primitive and is deferred.
