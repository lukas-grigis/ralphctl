/**
 * Bracketed-paste detector for the text-input prompts. Terminals that honour DEC mode 2004
 * (enabled at the Ink mount — see `ink-host.ts`) wrap pasted content in
 * `ESC[200~` … `ESC[201~` so the application can tell a paste apart from typed keystrokes. This
 * matters because Ink's `useInput` hands each raw stdin chunk to `parseKeypress` as one event:
 *
 *   • A pasted line break arrives as a carriage return (`\r`), which `parseKeypress` reports as
 *     `key.return` — i.e. a plain paste of multi-line text would trigger a premature submit and
 *     collapse the lines.
 *   • A large paste can be split across stdin chunks; a chunk that happens to equal `\r` is again
 *     parsed as Enter.
 *
 * Bracketed paste removes the ambiguity: everything between the markers is literal text, never a
 * key. This hook buffers chunks across `useInput` invocations until the closing marker arrives,
 * then surfaces the whole payload as a single normalized string to a callback.
 *
 * Interception point: the prompt calls {@link PasteController.consume} at the *top* of its own
 * `useInput` callback. While a paste is in flight (or a chunk carries the start marker), `consume`
 * returns `true` and the prompt returns early — so the marker bytes and the pasted line breaks
 * never reach the prompt's key-dispatch (`key.return`, printable-insert, …) branches.
 *
 * Marker shapes handled: the canonical `ESC[200~` / `ESC[201~`, and the bare `[200~` / `[201~`
 * forms that appear once Ink strips a leading ESC from the chunk (see the `isMouseReport` guard in
 * the prompts, which mirrors the same Ink behaviour). The inner `ESC` before a trailing `[201~`
 * inside one chunk is also tolerated.
