/**
 * Context flowing through the implement chain. Optional fields populate as upstream leaves run:
 *  - `sprint` — set by `loadSprintLeaf`.
 *  - `execution` — set by `loadSprintExecutionLeaf`.
 *  - `tasks` — set by `loadTasksLeaf`; mutated by per-task leaves so persistence carries the
 *    latest transitions.
 *  - `progressFile` — absolute path to `<sprintDir>/progress.md`, supplied via `opts.progressFile`
 *    (derived by the launcher); appended to by the `progress-journal` leaves.
 *  - `currentTaskId` / `currentTask` — written by `start-attempt` for the in-flight task; consumed
 *    by gen-eval leaves, `commit-task`, and `settle-attempt`.
 *  - `genEvalTurn` — turn counter inside the gen-eval loop, incremented by `generator` leaf.
 *  - `lastEvaluation` — latest evaluator signal; used by the evaluator leaf for plateau detection.
 *  - `lastExitKind` — set when a gen-eval terminal condition is reached (by `generator` /
 *    `evaluator`) or by `finalize-gen-eval` (budget-exhausted).
 *  - `lastWarning` — derived from gen-eval exit / `lastVerifyResult`; consumed by `settle-attempt`.
 *  - `lastVerdict` — passed/failed/malformed; set by `finalize-gen-eval`.
 *  - `lastBlockReason` — set by `generator` on `self-blocked`; drives `markTaskBlocked`.
 *  - `lastVerifyResult` — set by `post-task-verify`.
 *  - `lastCommitSha` — set by `commit-task` if the tree was dirty and the commit landed.
 *  - `proposedCommitMessage` — generator-emitted `<commit-message>` signal from the latest
 *    turn that produced one. Consumed by `commit-task`'s default message factory. Carries
 *    across turns: when the loop iterates, the latest non-undefined value wins so the final
 *    commit reflects the final accepted state of the work.
 *  - `expectedBranch` — branch name `resolveBranchLeaf` checked out on the working tree.
 *    Stamped after persistence so per-task `branchPreflightLeaf` can short-circuit when the
 *    current ref doesn't match (e.g. the user manually `git checkout`-ed mid-run).
